      "Running payroll in Sri Lanka comes with strict EPF/ETF requirements and real financial consequences when things go wrong. Teams often inherit legacy spreadsheets, inconsistent inputs, and tribal knowledge about how allowances should be treated. Over time, each ‘small’ exception creates drift that shows up as under‑contributions, late filings, and audit findings. The goal of this guide is to help you spot the patterns, fix root causes, and ship a clean monthly file without heroics.",
      "Start with definitions. EPF (Employees’ Provident Fund) and ETF (Employees’ Trust Fund) are contributory schemes calculated on the ‘contributory salary’ rather than the entire gross. Misclassifying what belongs in the base is the most common source of error. For example, some teams exclude recurring allowances that should be included, or include reimbursements that should be excluded. Your policy must precisely list which earnings codes are contributory and which are not.",
      "Mistake #1: Using the wrong base. If your payroll has multiple earning types (basic, cost of living, attendance bonus, incentive, etc.), make sure your configuration maps each to ‘contributory: yes/no’. Do a sampling exercise across departments and seniority levels to ensure the rule is applied consistently. When in doubt, confirm with your payroll advisor or refer to the latest guidance from the Department of Labour.",
      "Mistake #2: Wrong contribution rates. Employer and employee percentages can change with policy, and some industries or schemes have special rules. Hard‑coding rates in spreadsheets without a single source of truth invites mistakes. Keep the current rates in your HR system’s configuration, lock the sheet against ad hoc edits, and record change history with an owner and an effective date.",
      "Mistake #3: Late or partial filings. Submissions are time‑bound. Delays often come from rework after last‑minute adjustments: back pay, corrections, or new joiners that were not captured. Create a cut‑off calendar—data freeze, calculation, maker review, checker approval, payment, and filing. Communicate deadlines to managers so they avoid sending last‑minute changes that derail the run.",
      "Mistake #4: Missing new joiners and terminations. If the onboarding process is outside the HR system or handled by email, it is easy to miss adding a new employee to EPF/ETF. The fix is process, not heroics: onboarding must create a record in the system with all statutory fields before payroll cut‑off, and offboarding must trigger a status change. Avoid manual re‑keying between HR, attendance, and payroll.",
      "Mistake #5: Duplicate or inconsistent records. When spreadsheets are shared across teams, versions fork. Two similarly named employees can end up with separate rows and different totals. Always generate the monthly EPF/ETF export from a single system of record with a unique employee ID. Validate the file for duplicates before submission.",
      "Mistake #6: Variable pay handling. Attendance‑linked incentives, overtime, or allowances can fluctuate. Ensure the transformation from attendance to payroll is automated and repeatable. If you rely on CSV uploads, standardize column names and formats, and validate row counts against expectations (e.g., number of active employees).",
      "Mistake #7: Post‑payroll corrections without audit trail. Adjustments happen—what matters is the trail. Use maker‑checker approvals for any changes after calculation. Record the reason, approver, and affected employees. Reflect corrections in the next run or submit an amended file if required.",
      "Now the fixes. First, build a ‘contributory map’—a table that lists every earning code with its EPF/ETF treatment. Socialize it with HR, finance, and payroll owners and version‑control it. Second, implement pre‑run validation: a quick report that compares this month’s contributory totals with last month’s and flags outliers by employee and department. Third, lock rate configuration with effective dates and restrict edits to admins.",
      "Standardize the monthly workflow. A proven cadence looks like this: (1) attendance and variable pay freeze on day X; (2) payroll calculation on day X+1; (3) maker review and sampling on X+2; (4) checker approval on X+3; (5) payslip release on X+4; (6) EPF/ETF exports generated and reconciled on X+5; (7) remittance and filing submitted before statutory deadlines. Document the timeline and share it with stakeholders.",
      "Reconcile and report. Produce a monthly pack that ties employee counts, contributory totals, and remittances. Include a change log with hires, exits, and corrections. When auditors visit, you can produce three artifacts on demand: the contributory map, the configuration screenshot (rates, codes), and the EPF/ETF export with checksums that match payment proofs.",
      "Finally, reduce manual work. Use an HR system that can compute EPF/ETF from configured rules, generate exports in the correct formats, and store approvals. If you must stay on spreadsheets, adopt discipline: protect formulas, minimize copy‑paste, and never create one‑off tabs per month. Discipline wins more than heroics.",
      "The payoff is real. A clean monthly file, fewer disputes, and faster close save hours across HR and finance. Most importantly, you protect employees’ long‑term savings by getting contributions right—every time.",

      "Attendance devices are only as good as the operational discipline around them. A single offline reader can create hundreds of missing swipes, which later snowball into payroll disputes and morale issues. The goal is not to ‘collect more swipes’ but to design a resilient pipeline: reliable hardware, clear policy, automated reconciliation, and transparent visibility for employees and managers.",
      "Start by mapping the flow: device -> network -> collector -> HR system -> payroll. For each hop, define expected latency and monitoring. Devices should heartbeat; collectors should alert when no data arrives for N minutes; and the HR system should flag yesterday’s gaps every morning. Treat attendance like payments—no logs means an incident, not a ‘we’ll check later’.",
      "Device reliability. Prefer wired ethernet or stable Wi‑Fi; poor connectivity creates silent failures. Keep a register of device firmware versions and maintenance dates. Assign ownership to a local admin who can reboot or escalate. If using mobile attendance, enforce geofences and selfie checks to reduce spoofing.",
      "Data quality. Standardize the fields you ingest: employee ID, timestamp, device ID, and direction (in/out). Reject malformed records early with readable errors, not silent drops. If multiple device brands are involved, normalize at the edge so the HR system receives a single schema.",
      "Policy clarity. Employees need to know what happens when a swipe is missed. A simple, fair rule works best: self‑declare within 24 hours with a reason; manager approves or rejects; repeated misses escalate. Limit backdating and require notes. Publish examples of acceptable reasons (device down, client site visit) and non‑acceptable ones (forgot, came late).",
      "Reconciliation. Run a daily job that detects anomalies: missing IN or OUT, impossible sequences, or overlapping shifts. Present these in a manager dashboard with filters (date, location, team). Approval clicks should create an audit record that flows into payroll so no one re‑keys data.",
      "Edge cases. Night shifts crossing midnight, split shifts, and on‑call windows often break naive rules. Model shifts explicitly and calculate expected swipes accordingly. For field teams, capture location hints (GPS or site code) so reviewers can validate context.",
      "Communication and trust. Give employees access to their own logs and balances. Seeing issues early reduces disputes. For managers, weekly summaries of ‘teams with most anomalies’ surface coaching opportunities. Celebrate teams that drop anomalies month over month.",
      "Integration to payroll. The final attendance register should be a clean table that payroll can consume without VLOOKUP gymnastics. Tie employee IDs, dates, totals (hours/OT), and approved exceptions. A checksum of records helps finance verify imports match what was reviewed.",
      "Security and privacy. Limit who can edit logs, require reasons for changes, and export an audit trail. For mobile apps, store only what’s necessary and be transparent about location usage.",
      "When this pipeline is in place, the result is boring in the best way: fewer no‑shows, fewer disputes, and a payroll cycle that closes on time. Your devices didn’t get better—your system did.",

      "A clear leave policy is one of the easiest ways to improve employee experience—and one of the most common sources of conflict when it’s vague. In Sri Lanka, statutory rules interact with company practices (like additional casual days or optional holidays). The objective is consistency: write it down, configure it in your HR system, and give everyone visibility to the same numbers.",
      "Policy structure. Start with eligibility and working days per week. Define categories: annual, casual, sick, maternity, no‑pay, and any company‑specific types. Explain accrual frequency (monthly, annually), proration rules for joiners/leavers, and how partial months are handled. Specify who approves what and how long approvals can remain pending.",
      "Accruals and carry‑forwards. Set the accrual rate per category and the maximum carry‑forward (if any). Many teams carry forward a limited portion of annual leave; casual leave often expires. Whatever you choose, encode it in the system so it is automatically enforced at year‑end, not negotiated via spreadsheets.",
      "Holiday calendars. If you operate across locations, maintain site‑specific calendars with Poya and public holidays. Tie each employee to a calendar and ensure scheduling tools read the same source. Before the year starts, publish calendars and ask managers to plan around known peaks.",
      "Visibility is non‑negotiable. Employees should see their balances, pending requests, and a team calendar to avoid clashes. Managers need a heatmap for who is off when, so they can approve fairly. When everyone sees the same source of truth, arguments drop dramatically.",
      "Requests and approvals. Keep the flow simple: employee requests dates and type; the system validates balance and overlaps; manager approves or rejects with notes. Limit backdating and require reasons. If you allow cancellations or changes, define the cut‑off and who approves them.",
      "Special cases. Maternity leave, long medical leave, and leave without pay require extra documentation. Create checklists and attach requirements to the request form (e.g., medical certificates). Protect privacy—only HR and the approver should see sensitive attachments.",
      "Reporting. Track utilization by team and location. Spot teams that never take leave (burnout risk) or where requests are frequently rejected (capacity issues). Share a quarterly report with leadership and use trends to adjust staffing during peak seasons.",
      "Year‑end. Automate carry‑forward, encashment (if applicable), and balance resets. Communicate changes well in advance and provide a window for employees to use expiring balances. Avoid manual mass edits; let the system do the math with logs.",
      "Implementation tips. Pilot the policy with a friendly team, collect feedback, and then roll out broadly. Publish an FAQ with examples: half‑day requests, overlapping requests, and travel days. Reinforce the message that fairness comes from clear rules plus consistent tooling.",
      "A good leave policy removes friction from everyday life. People plan confidently, managers balance coverage, and HR stops playing referee. That’s how you build trust—and keep operations smooth.",

The most effective audits are lightweight but regular—quarterly is ideal—so your team can fix problems incrementally rather than scramble during year‑end.",
      "Scope and ownership. Define what your audit covers: contracts and files, payroll configuration, EPF/ETF treatment, attendance integrity, leave policy enforcement, grievance logs, and data protection controls. Assign an owner for each domain—HR operations, finance/payroll, IT/security—and set a two‑week window to collect evidence and close actions.",
      "Contracts and files. Confirm every employee has a signed offer letter, job description, confidentiality and IP clauses, and any role‑specific addenda. For fixed‑term contracts, verify end dates and renewal triggers. For contractors, check scopes, payment terms, and that they are not misclassified employees. Store documents centrally with access logs.",
      "Payroll configuration. Reconcile gross‑to‑net formulas, tax tables, and the exact EPF/ETF contribution base. Validate the ‘contributory map’ for each earning type and confirm rates with effective dates. Spot‑check payslips across departments for correctness and timing. Ensure maker‑checker approvals exist for back pay, ad‑hoc allowances, and terminations.",

For each line, specify: source report, reviewer, variance threshold, and sign‑off date. Use last month and last year comparisons to catch anomalies.",
